Measured the unknown inductor and capacitor with AC bridge and simulation experiment on $Multisim$ platform

The AC bridge is a classic experimental circuit. Based on the bridge balance principle, AC bridge can be used to measure the parameters of unknown circuit components. This measurement method is simple and convenient with high accuracy, and has wide applications in high-precision measurement, automatic control and other fields. In this experiment, we measure the capacitance, impedance and loss factor of the unknown capacitor using capacitor bridge, and the inductance, impedance and quality factor of the unknown inductor using Maxwell-Vine bridge. These results were compared with the results measured with digital bridge meter. We also conducted simulation experiments on the $Multisim$ circuit simulation platform and compared them with the real experimental results to investigate the factors affecting the results of this experiment. It was found that the capacitance measurement results differed from the digital bridge and simulation, and the latter two results were similar; while the inductance measurement results were similar to the simulation results, and the digital bridge measurement differed from the former two. The key point of this experiment is the fineness of the adjustment of the AC bridge equilibrium state, and the biggest factor limiting the accuracy of the experiment is the precision of the experimental instrument.
