  abstract = {Optical fiber biosensors have attracted extensive research attention in fields such as public health research, environmental science, bioengineering, disease diagnosis and drug research. Accurate detection of biomolecules is essential to limit the extent of disease outbreaks and provide valuable guidance for regulatory agencies to take timely measures. Among many optical fiber sensors, optical fiber biosensors based on specialty fibers have the advantages of biocompatibility, small size, high measurement resolution, high stability and immunity to electromagnetic interference. In this paper, four types interferometer biosensors based on specialty fiber, namely Mach-Zehnder interferometer, Michelson interferometer, Fabry - Perot interferometer and Sagnac interferometer, are reviewed in terms of operating principles, sensing structure and application fields. The fiber types are further divided into micro-nano optical fiber, thin core fiber, polarization maintaining fiber, polymer fiber, microstructure optical fiber. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of these interferometer biosensors. Finally, main challenging problems and expectational development direction of specialty fiber interferometer biosensors are summarized. This text clearly shows the huge development potential of optical fiber biosensors in biomedical.},
