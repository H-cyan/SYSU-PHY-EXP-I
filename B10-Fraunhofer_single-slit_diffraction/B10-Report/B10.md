# B10/B16 夫琅禾费单缝衍射实验与仿真

## CH

夫琅禾费单缝衍射是指平行光通过尺寸接近波长的狭缝时，偏离传播方向而在无穷远处形成衍射条纹的现象。其衍射条纹具有一个能量集中的主极大，其余次极大对称分布，且光强随级次升高而迅速衰减。在条纹中心附近，次级条纹角宽度近似等于主极大的半角宽。本实验中，我们使用光功率计测量氦氖激光夫琅禾费单缝衍射各级条纹相对光强分布，并将实验结果和理论曲线进行对比。同时我们检查了光功率计是否工作在线性区。最后我们使用$Seelight$光学仿真平台进行了仿真实验。

我们首先测量了氦氖激光夫琅禾费单缝衍射各级条纹相对光强分布，与理论曲线对比后发现主极大符合较好，但次级大相对光强偏低，且暗纹处光强并非为零。同时我们计算了各级暗纹距离，发现与理论预测相符。接下来，我们使用光功率计测量了不同距离处溴钨灯光的光功率，证实了光功率计工作在线性区内。最后，我们在$Seelight$光学平台上使用同样的实验参数搭建了实验模型，进行了仿真实验并验证仿真结果。

Fraunhofer single-slit diffraction describes a phenomenon in which when parallel light passes through a slit with dimensions close to the wavelength, it deviates from the direction of propagation and forms diffraction streaks at infinity. The diffraction streak has a primary maximum with a great energy concentration, and those secondary maximums symmetrically distributed around it. Also, the light intensity decays rapidly as the diffraction order increases. Near the center of the streak, the angular width of the secondary streak is approximately equal to the half-angle width of the primary maximum. In this experiment, we use an optical power meter to measure the relative intensity distribution of the streaks of He-Ne laser Fronhofer single-slit diffraction pattern and compare it with the theoretical curve. We also check whether the optical power meter works in its linear region. Finally, we conducted a simulation experiment on the $Seelight$ optical simulation platform.

First, we measured the relative intensity distribution of the stripes at each level of He-Ne laser Fronhofer single-slit diffraction pattern and compared it with the theoretical curve. We found that the primary maximum is in good agreement with the theoretical curve, but those secondary maximums are relatively low. What’s more, the intensity at those dark stripes is not zero. We also calculated the  distance of the dark streaks at each level, and found that it was in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. Next, we measured the optical power of the bromine tungsten light at different distances using an optical power meter, and confirmed that the optical power meter operated within the linear region. Finally, we built an model on the $Seelight$ optical platform using the same experimental parameters, conducted simulation experiments and verified the simulation results.
