# C3.1 光谱仪测量原子发射光谱

## 中文摘要

玻尔原子模型指出，当原子从一种定态跃迁到另一种定态时，将辐射或吸收一定频率的光子，光子的能量由这两个定态的能量差决定。这一发现成功解释了氢原子光谱的不连续性，为量子理论的发展奠定了基础，同时该发现在物质组分和结构分析领域也有着重要应用。对原子发射光谱的精密测量是理解原子跃迁过程的物理基础，本实验中，我们采用基于反射光栅的光学多道分析仪（OMA）测量原子发射光谱。

我们扫描了九种实验室常用光源（汞灯，钠灯，氢氘灯，溴钨灯和五种颜色的LED灯）的原子发射光谱，发现其中汞灯，钠灯和氢氘灯光谱为分立谱，而溴钨灯和五种颜色LED灯光谱为连续谱。接下来，对于分立谱光源，我们使用测量得到的汞灯谱线与标准谱线对比得到标定关系，并据此标定了其他谱线，同时我们基于在更小光栅距离下测量得到的钠灯光谱，研究了钠双黄线的特征。最后，对于连续谱光源，我们使用高斯函数插值计算LED灯的波包中心波长及其半高宽，并研究了溴钨灯光源的光谱特点。

According to the Bohr's atom model, when an atom jumps from one fixed state to another, it will radiate or absorb photons of a certain frequency, and the energy of the photon is determined by the energy difference between these two fixed states. This discovery successfully explained the discontinuity of the hydrogen atom spectrum and laid a solid foundation for the development of quantum theory. What's more, it also has important applications in the field of component and structure analysis of the matter. The precise measurement of the atomic emission spectra is the physical basis for understanding the atomic leap processes. In this experiment, we use an optical multichannel analyzer (OMA)  based on the reflection grating to measure the atomic emission spectra.

We scanned the atomic emission spectra of nine commonly used laboratory light sources (mercury lamp, sodium lamp, hydrogen-deuterium lamp, bromine tungsten lamp and LED bulbs of five colors) and found that the spectra of mercury, sodium and hydrogen-deuterium lamps are discrete spectra, while the spectra of bromine tungsten lamp and LED bulbs of five colors are continuous spectra. Next, for light sources with discrete spectra, we obtained the calibration relationship by comparing the measured spectrum with the standard spectrum of the mercury lamp , and calibrated the other spectra accordingly. We also investigated the characteristics of the sodium doublet basing on the spectrum measured at a smaller grating distance. Finally, for light sources with continuous spectra, we used Gaussian interpolation method to calculate the central wavelengths and the half-height widths of the wave packets presented in the spectra of LED bulbs, as well as investigated the spectral characteristics of the bromine tungsten lamp.
