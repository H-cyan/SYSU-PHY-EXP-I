# C3.3 基于光纤光谱仪的吸收光谱测量

## 中文摘要

比尔-朗博定律指出，当光透过一定浓度溶液时，溶液中的吸光分子将吸收光，导致光强减弱。当溶液浓度不大时，液体吸收系数与浓度成正比。这一理论揭示了溶液吸光规律，并且在利用吸收光谱分析法快速测定溶液浓度等领域有着重要应用。本实验中，我们使用光纤光谱仪测量溴钨灯通过不同浓度红墨水溶液的吸收光谱，并计算吸收系数，验证比尔定律及其成立条件。

我们首先测量并比较了溴钨灯光谱、空比色皿吸收光谱与纯水吸收光谱，发现纯水在可见光范围内对光一般吸收，光谱峰值波长几乎不变，而空比色皿吸收光谱相对强度较弱。接下来，我们测量了不同浓度红墨水溶液的吸收光谱，发现随浓度上升，吸收光谱峰值波长向长波方向移动。最后我们计算了不同浓度红墨水溶液的吸收系数，发现在较低浓度，吸收系数与浓度成正比，但在较高浓度，溶液对光吸收趋于饱和。

Bill Lambert's law states that when light passes through a solution of a certain concentration, the light-absorbing molecules in the solution will absorb the light, resulting in a weakening of the light intensity. At low concentrations, the absorption coefficient of the solution is proportional to the concentration. This theory reveals the law of light absorption in solution and has important applications in fields such as the rapid measurement of solution concentrations using absorption spectroscopy. In this experiment, we use a fiber optic spectrometer to measure the absorption spectra of the light generated by a bromine-tungsten lamp passing through different concentrations of red ink solutions and calculate the absorption coefficients to verify Beer's law and its conditions of validity.

We first measured and compared the spectra of the bromine-tungsten lamp, the absorption spectra of the empty cuvette and pure water, and found that pure water generally absorbs light in the visible range with almost constant peak spectral wavelength, while the absorption spectra of the empty cuvette is relatively weak in intensity. Next, we measured the absorption spectra of different concentrations of red ink solutions and found that the peak spectral wavelength of the absorption spectrum gradually increased as the concentration of red ink increased. Finally, we calculated the absorption coefficients of different concentrations of red ink solutions and found that at lower concentrations, the absorption coefficients were proportional to the concentration, while at higher concentrations, the absorption of light by the solution tended to saturate.
